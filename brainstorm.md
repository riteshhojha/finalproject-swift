# Brainstorming

## Problem
People often miss local events because:
- They don’t know they’re happening
- Info is scattered across apps and sites

## Users
- Students looking for fun events
- Newcomers in a city
- Event organizers wanting more attendees

## Features Ideas
- Show local events on a map and list
- Filter by category (music, food, etc.)
- Save/favorite events
- Share events

## API Ideas
- Eventbrite API
- Ticketmaster API
- Meetup API
